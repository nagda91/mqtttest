# mqtttest if someone read it
Hi!
I made this code to test mosquittopp library on my raspberryPi 2(with raspbian, latest at 2018.09.25.), and try github.
There are some hungarian words in the code, so sorry for that.
if someone has problem with the reconnect() function(like me), i wrote a new one which works perfectly for me. There is 
another one in mosquittopp.h but that didn't work for me.

if you have any advice, please share with me, thank you.
